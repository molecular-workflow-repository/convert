description: Translate a molecule between a variety of file formats, chemical ids, and python objects.
methods: |
  This is a utility workflow for transforming molecular data. It provides ways to interconvert
  between the following forms of chemical information:
    - Chemical identifiers (SMILES, IUPAC names, inCHI identifiers, PDB ids)
    - File formats (PDB, mmCIF, XYZ, SDF, mol2)
    - Python objects (MDT, OpenBabel, BioPython parmED, openMM, PySCF)
  `molflow` will call this workflow automatically to translate user input before running
   your requested workflow; this workflow will therefore be updated frequently to accomodate
   additional functionality.
